 * iovec accumulation arithmetic: the parts a proof can reach
 *
 * Copyright 2026 elfuse contributors

 *
 * readv, writev, preadv, pwritev, recvmsg and sendmsg all take an iovec array
 * the guest wrote, and every one of them sums iov_len across it. Linux returns
 * EINVAL when that sum exceeds SSIZE_MAX; elfuse has to do the same, because
 * the sum reaches a malloc extent and a memcpy loop on the /proc
 * write-intercept path. A wrapped sum there is a small allocation followed by a
 * large copy.
 *
 * io.c carried four copies of the accumulation with three different guards, and
 * proc_try_writev_intercept had none at all: it summed straight into malloc().
 * That one was unreachable in practice, since host_iov_prepare clamps each
 * entry to the guest mapping it points into, but unreachable by provenance
 * rather than by construction. One proved add now serves every site:
 * urandom_fill_iov, validate_iov_total, proc_try_writev_intercept and
 * process_vm_import_iov.
 *
 * Split into a header because io.c and net-msg.c cannot be given to Frama-C:
 * they include the macOS uio and socket headers, which the analyzer's libc does
 * not model. This header needs only stdint.h and sys/uio.h, and the analyzer
 * supplies its own modeled sys/uio.h, so make verify-iov proves it directly.

/* How many iovec entries a partial transfer of `moved` bytes has fully spent,

 *
 * The caller resumes at iov + result with iovcnt - result entries, after
 * trimming that survivor by *rem_out. Splitting the index arithmetic out from
 * the pointer bump is what makes the useful half provable: the two facts a
 * caller needs before touching the survivor are that the index is in range and
 * that the remainder is strictly inside it, and both are postconditions here.
 * The bump itself stays in io.c, since iov_base points into guest memory whose
 * extent no contract in this tree can name.
 *
 * The last postcondition is what ties the remainder back to the bytes moved.
 * Without it the contract is satisfied by a loop that never subtracts anything,
 * since the exit condition alone already puts rem below the entry it indexes;
 * make verify-mutants found exactly that hole by deleting the subtraction.
 *
 * The separation precondition is not ceremony: without it *rem_out and the
 * array may alias, the store can change the length the second postcondition
 * talks about, and the proof fails. Every caller passes a local.

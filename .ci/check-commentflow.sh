# clang-format breaks a comment line that runs past ColumnLimit but never
# refills a short-wrapped one, so comment width is the one part of the house
# style no other gate settles. commentflow reads the same ColumnLimit, which
# keeps comment width and code width on one number.
#
# The selection below is the one both callers use, "make indent" through --write
# and "make check-format" and the Lint workflow through the default, so what
# gets rewritten is what gets checked. The extension list in that workflow's
# cfpat decides whether the check runs at all, and has to track it.

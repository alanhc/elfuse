# Verify clang-format conformance for all tracked C/H files in src/ and tests/.
# The repository's .clang-format is calibrated against clang-format-22; older
# versions produce different output and are rejected to keep CI deterministic.
#
# Exit codes, matching .ci/check-commentflow.sh: 0 clean, 1 files differ from
# the style, 2 the check could not run. The split matters to the pre-commit
# hook, which blocks on 1 and only warns on 2: a machine without the pinned
# formatter has not shown you a defect, and turning that into a failed commit
# teaches contributors to pass --no-verify. CI fails on either.

# Kept apart, because the two answers have different consequences and one of
# them must not be able to mask the other. A file that differs is a defect in
# the change and blocks; a file the formatter could not read or parse is not,
# and reporting it as a style violation sends the author to reformat code that
# was already fine. A named path that does not exist reached the diff below and
# came back as "this file differs" in its entirety, which is the mistyped-path
# case .ci/check-security.sh guards against by name.

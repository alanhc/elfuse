"""Fail when a lock exists that the lock-order document does not name.

src/syscall/internal.h opens with the acquisition order, and that block is the
only place the tree records which lock may be taken under which. It is prose, so
nothing stopped it from falling behind the code: at the time this check was
written it named 9 of the tree's 31 file-scope locks (one of those under a
shortened spelling that did not match the symbol), and seven of the twenty-two
it left out genuinely nested (autoreap_lock over pid_lock and pidfd_lock,
elf_path_lock over cwd_lock and sysroot_lock, oom_write_lock over fd_lock,
fuse_lock over the per-session lock, proc_tmpdir_lock over mmap_lock,
pty_keepalive_lock over fd_lock, cwd_lock over fuse_lock). Every one of those
was correct as written. The defect was that a reader adding the next lock had
no rule to consult, and an inversion is not the kind of bug the test suite
finds: it needs the two threads to interleave the one way that deadlocks, on a
machine loaded enough to make that likely, which describes CI and not a
developer's laptop.

So the document claims to be exhaustive, and this makes the claim true. Two
directions, both a set comparison rather than an analysis:

  1. Every file-scope pthread_mutex_t and pthread_rwlock_t under src/ appears
     in the block.
  2. Every lock the block names still exists in the source.

What this deliberately does NOT do is decide whether a lock belongs in the
ordered list or the leaf list. That question is "is this lock ever held across
another acquisition", which needs the call graph, and a branch-insensitive
answer to it is wrong in both directions: a linear scan of fuse.c drops
fuse_lock at an early-return unlock and calls it a leaf, while the same scan
reads two comments mentioning sys_close() as an sfd_lock/fd_lock cycle. Both
happened while auditing this. A gate that cries wolf gets an exemption list and
then gets ignored, so the placement stays a human judgement and only the
membership is mechanical. Placing a new lock wrongly is a mistake review can
catch; forgetting it entirely is the one nothing was looking for.

# The declarator list is captured whole rather than as one name, because every
# form of it has to be seen. A sharded "pthread_mutex_t shard_locks[16];" is the
# most likely next lock in a tree that already contends on mmap_lock, and a
# pattern anchored on "= PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER" or on a single identifier
# misses it silently, which is the one way for a gate to be worse than no gate.
#
# pthread_rwlock_t counts as a lock too. The tree has two of them today
# (sysinfo_lock in syscall/sys.c, overlay_lock in syscall/chown-overlay.c), and
# a gate that only knew about pthread_mutex_t would have let the block claim to
# be exhaustive while both sat outside it.
#
# Everything between the type and the semicolon is captured, initializers
# included, and the structure is taken apart afterwards. Splitting it in the
# pattern cannot work: an initializer clause that stops at the first comma drops
# the declarators after it ("first = A, second;" loses second), one that runs to
# the semicolon swallows them, and one that refuses braces skips a brace
# initializer outright. All three are silent misses, which is the one shape
# worse than no gate. A function definition survives this because its declarator
# keeps the parenthesis or the leading star that declared_names rejects.

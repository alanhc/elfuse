 * NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT silent-socket contract: the surface libusb_init()'s

 *
 * Asserts, in the order libusb performs them:
 *   socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW|SOCK_NONBLOCK|SOCK_CLOEXEC,
 *          NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT) succeeds,
 *   bind(nl_groups=1) succeeds (and nl_groups=2, nusb's udev group),
 *   setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_PASSCRED, 1) succeeds and reads back 1,
 *   getsockopt(SO_RCVBUF/SO_TYPE) report sane values,
 *   a drained socket is not readable: non-blocking recv reports EAGAIN and
 *   poll() times out,
 *   send() to the kernel-side netlink address (nl_pid 0) either fails with
 *   EPERM (elfuse refuses guests the authority to fabricate uevents) or is
 *   swallowed whole (a real Linux kernel's netlink_unicast() to the uevent
 *   handler returns the payload length; the handler's own CAP_SYS_ADMIN
 *   refusal only travels back as an NLMSG_ERROR ack, and a payload shorter
 *   than NLMSG_HDRLEN is skipped silently),
 *   and a NETLINK_ROUTE socket still opens, so the uevent path did not
 *   disturb the rtnetlink emulation.
 *
 * Then the SOL_SOCKET surface sk_setsockopt()/sk_getsockopt() define on any
 * socket, which a netlink fd has to answer the same way:
 *   SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF clamp to the sysctl, double, and floor at
 *   SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF and SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF -- two different floors, one twice
 *   the other,
 *   SO_RCVTIMEO actually bounds a blocking receive rather than being
 *   swallowed, in all three of sock_set_timeout()'s states (finite, forever,
 *   and the negative tv_sec that means "do not wait"),
 *   the options whose payload is not an int refuse a four-byte optlen,
 *   a getsockopt with a short optlen writes only what it reports and one with
 *   a negative optlen writes nothing at all,
 *   and every option that can be set can be read back.
 *
 * Then netlink_create()'s socket-type validation, and the SOL_NETLINK level:
 * the membership pair, the flag booleans a libnl/libmnl monitor sets on the way
 * up, and the bitmap NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS reads back -- all under the same
 * contract bind() gives, recorded and never delivered on.
 *
 * The assertions hold for the elfuse emulation and for a real Linux kernel with
 * no hotplug activity during the run (the test matrix runs this binary under
 * qemu-aarch64 too). Genuine uevents arriving mid-run are tolerated by draining
 * before every readability check.
 *
 * The handful of answers that genuinely differ between the two are not asserted
 * as a disjunction that both lanes pass by accident. on_elfuse below names the
 * lane once, from the one probe whose answer is unambiguous, and each such
 * assertion states the strict outcome for the lane it is running in.
 *
 * Nothing here pins a number a kernel build is free to choose. SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF
 * is 2048 + SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct sk_buff)), which depends on the
 * config, and net.core.rmem_max is a sysctl, so the floors and the clamp are
 * asserted through relations that hold whatever those turn out to be: the send
 * floor is exactly twice the receive floor, and two requests that both exceed
 * the sysctl read back equal.

     * io_wait_fd_timed_or_interrupted() reports EINTR for two unrelated
     * reasons. One is a signal the guest can see. The other is the dispatcher's
     * own execve handoff, which the leader leaves its wait for so the run loop
     * can reach it, and which carries no signal at all. Refusing the SVC
     * restart for both turned a sibling's execve -- even one that fails -- into
     * an EINTR on a recvmsg the guest issued once, an errno Linux cannot
     * produce there. Below, an execve fails every 20 ms for the whole of a
     * two-second SO_RCVTIMEO and the receive still has to come back with EAGAIN
     * at the deadline it was given.
     *
     * The elapsed time is the other half. A restart re-enters the wait from the
     * top, so one that took a fresh copy of SO_RCVTIMEO rather than resuming
     * the deadline would push the return out by two seconds per interruption --
     * around a hundred of them here -- and the watchdog rather than the upper
     * bound is what would catch it. Resuming the deadline is what Linux's
     * restart_block carries.

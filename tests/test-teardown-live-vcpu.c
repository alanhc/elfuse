 * Teardown must never cross-thread-destroy a live or bring-up worker vCPU

 *
 * HVF vCPUs are thread-affine: only the creating thread may run or destroy a
 * vCPU. When the process tears down (main thread exit_group -> guest_destroy)
 * while worker threads still own live vCPUs, the teardown path must not call
 * hv_vcpu_destroy on a worker's vCPU from the main thread, nor hv_vm_destroy /
 * munmap the guest slab while a worker vCPU is still live. Doing either frees a
 * kernel vCPU object out from under its owning thread and faults the host
 * kernel (near-null dereference of the freed, poisoned vCPU struct).
 *
 * Two windows are exercised, each ending in exit_group(42):
 *
 *   spin:    a batch of workers spins on sched_yield, so every worker is inside
 *            hv_vcpu_run (a live vCPU) when the main thread calls exit_group.
 *            Teardown scans the thread table with those vCPUs still owned by
 *            their threads.
 *
 *   bringup: a burst of workers is cloned and the main thread calls exit_group
 *            immediately, so some workers are still mid-bring-up -- the slot is
 *            active but the vCPU handle has not been published yet -- when the
 *            teardown scan runs. Such a worker is about to create and enter its
 *            own vCPU, so teardown must treat it as live and defer, not skip
 * it.
 *
 * A clean exit with code 42 means teardown neither destroyed a foreign vCPU nor
 * tore the VM down under one. A crash, a host fault, or a hang (turned into a
 * timeout failure by the driver) means the teardown race is back.
 *
 * Syscalls: clone(220), nanosleep(101), sched_yield(124), exit_group(94)

/*
 * setuid-on-exec must grant an ID the guest can actually mean.
 *
 * A sysroot's files are owned by whoever unpacked them on the host, and no host
 * IDs are mapped into the guest. Honouring setuid on such a file would leave
 * the process at an effective ID that exists nowhere in the guest -- neither
 * root nor its own -- so the bit has to be ignored there, the way Linux ignores
 * it on a nosuid mount.
 *
 * Ownership the guest merely recorded is no better. The virtual chown overlay
 * accepts any unprivileged guest's chown, so an owner of 0 that came from it
 * proves nothing about privilege; only physical root ownership may elevate.
 * That is the case this test cannot stage without being root already, so what
 * it pins is the other half: a virtual owner, foreign or root, never elevates.
 *
 * Note which owner does the work. The set-id path reads the *physical* stat,
 * and mkstemp already leaves the helper owned by the host user (501 or whatever
 * unpacked the tree), which is foreign to the guest either way. The virtual
 * chowns below stage the guest-visible half; the physical host owner is what
 * the exec actually sees and refuses to honour.

 * elfuse backs a MAP_SHARED file mapping with a live host mmap overlay onto the
 * guest slab. Truncating the file leaves the overlay in place with no backing
 * page, so every host-side access from user mode raises SIGBUS and, without a
 * recovery pad, kills elfuse itself. Each case below drives one host path that
 * dereferences guest memory directly and expects EFAULT instead.
 *
 * Host syscall buffers are deliberately absent: the kernel reports EFAULT from
 * copyin/copyout rather than signaling, so read/write/sendmsg never needed a
 * pad.

 * aligned and the mmap gap finder keeps the slab side aligned. Should either
 * stop holding, the mapping falls back to snapshot pread, no host page can
 * vanish, and every case here passes without proving anything.
